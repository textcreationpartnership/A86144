            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Then were divers other Petitions read, which were formerly deliver'd by certain Troopers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other Commandors (which touched as well my Lord Generall as other Officers under whom they had ſerved) the complaints being of the like nature, and the complainers being heard what they could lay to their charge; Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> then anſwered, that what concerned my Lord Generall they muſt complain to the Lords houſe for redreſſe; But what concerned the Houſe of Commons, they ſhould be relieved in, with all convenient ſpeed, praying their patience in the meane time.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:112363:3"/>
            <p>There was alſo a complaint made againſt Col. <hi>Huncks,</hi> who was ordered to attend on <hi>Saturday</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe a complaint againſt Dr. <hi>Heywood</hi> of St. <hi>Giles</hi> in the <hi>Fields,</hi> for not ſuffering the order to be read in his Church, publiſhed by the houſe of Commons, concerning the pulling downe of the Rayles about the Communion Table, levelling the Church whereby ſome appoſition was made, &amp; he was ordered to attend on the <hi>Saturday</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Alſo a complaint againſt ſome Pariſhioners of St. <hi>Mary VVoolchurch,</hi> who had defaced a very faire windowe, &amp; other Emblem's of antiquity in that Church, without warrant, to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and defacing thereof, and warrants were granted for the offendors therein.</p>
            <p>This day was report made to the Committee that Cornet Ayers was fled into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 16. Sir <hi>Iohn Connyers</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring before the Committee, the ſeverall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints againſt him were read, unto every paricular of which, he pleaded Innocency, laying the fault (if any were) upon his inferior Officers, and that no pay had been ſtopt, but according to certain Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (which were produced and read) that he ſaid were drawne up by a generall agreement, which they denyed, pleading them to be an act of his owne and ſome few other Commanders, and not by generall conſent. But many things being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed againſt him, amongſt which, that he made certaine Troopers pay ten pounds for a horſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112363:3"/>to be loſt, which was afterwards found, but they had no reſtitution for it, whereupon hee confeſſed he remembred ſuch a thing was, but it was not his fault, they were not repayd their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney againe, and then entred into a long ſpeech in defence of himſelfe, that he had ſerved in forraign warres, and alwayes reſpected, but here contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, where he ſtrove to be moſt beloved, hee was moſt hated, having beene reproched both to his face and behind his back, and that undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that in that condition and quality wherein hee was, his Reputation was as deere unto him in that place and quality, he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a Souldier, as the greateſt Princes in the world, and he deſerved worthily to dye, if thoſe things objected againſt him, could be proved againſt him: And wherein he was calumniated he deſired Juſtice againſt ſome particular men, eſpecially againſt one <hi>Moore</hi> (who pleaded much againſt him) and others, and that he durſt ſcarce goe abroad, his life having been often threatned: Adding further, that the ſaid <hi>Moore</hi> was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned at <hi>Yorke</hi> by my Lord Generall, for ſaying (upon the disbanding) that his Sword was as ſharpe as the Generals, or the ſaid Sir <hi>Johns,</hi> and if he could not be ſatisfied he would get his pay as he could, (or to that effect) which might inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſome deſperate humour. But the ſaid <hi>Moore</hi> ſaid he was wrong'd in that, not denying hee was ſo impriſoned, but it was upon a wrong intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and after long time of hearing, both ſides deſiring
